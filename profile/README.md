Notebooks as a service (Naas) is an open source platform that allows anyone touching data (business analysts, scientists and engineers) to create powerful data engines combining automation, analytics and AI from the comfort of their Jupyter notebooks.

Naas is an attempt to propose an alternative to Google Colab, powered by the community.

In addition to Google Colab, Naas platform upgrade notebooks with with 3 low-code layers: features, drivers, templates.

- [**Templates**](https://docs.naas.ai/templates) enable the user to create automated data jobs and reports in minutes.
- [**Drivers**](https://docs.naas.ai/drivers) act as connectors to push and/or pull data from databases, APIs, and Machine Learning algorithms and more.
- [**Features**](https://docs.naas.ai/features) transform Jupyter in a production ready environment with scheduling, asset sharing, and notifications.

Try all of Naas's features for free using -- [Naas cloud](https://app.naas.ai/hub/login) -- a stable environment, without having to install anything.
